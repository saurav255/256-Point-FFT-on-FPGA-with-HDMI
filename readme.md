# 256-Point FFT on FPGA (ZedBoard) with HDMI Output

## Overview

This project implements a **256-point Decimation-in-Time (DIT) FFT** on the ZedBoard using custom Verilog and displays the real-time spectrum on an HDMI monitor.
The design integrates PL-based signal processing with PS-controlled video output, effectively turning the setup into a **hardware spectrum analyzer**.

The FFT core is written from scratch using state machines, verified in simulation, and then deployed on the FPGA. The computed samples are transferred from PL to PS through dual-port RAM and rendered via an HDMI pipeline built using Xilinx video IPs.

## HDMI Video Pipeline

The HDMI output is implemented using Xilinx IPs:

* Video Processing Subsystem
* Video Timing Controller
* AXI Stream to Video Out
* AXI VDMA
* Zynq PS control interface

The PS configures and controls the HDMI monitor while rendering FFT magnitude data in real time.

## Hardware Setup

Real-time signals were injected using Analog Discovery and XADC headers.

* Pure sine wave inputs
* Multi-tone combinations
* Observed peaks on HDMI display

## Data Transfer Architecture

* FFT computed in PL
* Results written to BRAM (PL side)
* PS reads BRAM data
* HDMI rendering handled by PS

This separation allows efficient computation in hardware while maintaining flexible visualization control.
